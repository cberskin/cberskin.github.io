      <p>Troop deployment in the Middle East and North Africa peaked in 2007 at 223,300 troops after 189,000 in 2006. In January 2007, President George W. Bush announced the deployment of more than 20,000 additional U.S. combat troops (Troop Surge in Iraq) to Iraq. The number was steady up until 2010, when it dropped to 100,000 troops, where it has stayed until the present day. The biggest spike was from 2002 to 2003, when troop deployment shot up from 3,000 to 140,000 due to the Iraq War.
Another noticeable spike came from 1989 to 1990, when troop deployment rose from 2,000 to 33,000 due to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Kuwait (The Gulf War) to acquire the nation’s largest oil reserves and expand his power in the region.
