      When immigration researcher Austin Kocher visited the U.S.-Mexico border during the early 2020s, the linguistic landscape shocked him.

  "When you're on the Mexican side of the border, you heard everything spoken," Kocher said. "French Creole, Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Russian, all that."
  
It wasn't supposed to sound like that. For decades, the U.S. border story centered on four countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. But according to Kocher's analysis of Customs and Border Protection data, 2022 marked a turning point that most Americans missed entirely.
"2022 was the first year that the 'all other countries' category was the largest category," said Kocher, a research director at the Immigrant ARC documentation project. "It was no longer Mexico or Central America. It was everyone."    </div>

An analysis of CBP encounter data from 2000 to 2023 confirms this seismic shift. While Mexican nationals still accounted for 2.4 million encounters from 2022 to 2025, the combined total from all other countries reached unprecedented levels. Chinese nationals saw encounters nearly triple from 27,756 in fiscal year 2022 to 78,701 in 2024—a 183% increase. Ecuador, rarely discussed in immigration debates, exploded from 24,936 encounters in 2022 to 124,023 in 2024, a staggering 397% jump.
Even more surprising: the routes these migrants take. Detailed CBP data shows significant concentrations at northern border field offices like Buffalo and Boston, suggesting organized migration through Canada that contradicts the public's mental image of border crossings.
In April 2022 alone, Buffalo's field office processed 713 Indian nationals, 233 Chinese nationals, and 169 Ukrainian nationals—numbers that would surprise most Americans who imagine border enforcement as exclusively a southern phenomenon.
"There's always going to be misperceptions about who is caught," Kocher said. "There's a long-standing perception that immigration is just about Mexicans, and it's never just been about Mexicans."
The diversification stems from what migration experts call "push-pull factors"—a combination of political and economic instability abroad and perceived opportunities in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic created what Kocher describes as "a real build up of humanitarian migration need along the border," and as pandemic restrictions wound down, migrants from around the globe seized the moment.
Some patterns have specific explanations. Ukrainian encounters spiked to 101,815 in fiscal year 2023 following Russia's invasion, then declined as other humanitarian pathways opened. Cuba's dramatic increase reflects changing U.S. policy toward the island nation. "Cubans used to have a more reliable lawful pathway," Kocher explained. "They no longer do. And so instead of coming through lawful pathways, they're essentially shifting and coming through unlawful pathways."    </div>

Haiti's encounters more than quadrupled from 2022 to 2024, jumping from 56,596 to 220,798—likely driven by the country's ongoing political collapse and gang violence. Colombia, despite being relatively stable compared to Venezuela, still saw 457,644 total encounters over the three-year period, suggesting economic motivations beyond immediate crisis.
The data also reveals something unexpected about the current administration's approach. Contrary to popular perception that President Trump focuses exclusively on the southern border, Kocher says enforcement has been "very comprehensive."
"They've done all kinds of things along the Canadian border as well," Kocher noted, citing the closure of the Peace Library crossing and increased arrests along the northern border. "I would say the Biden administration was focused much more narrowly on the U.S.-Mexico border than the Trump administration."
This comprehensive enforcement appears to be working as a deterrent. "We've had record lows of attempted border crossings in recent months," Kocher said, attributing it to changes in enforcement mechanisms and high-profile deportations. "I know that nobody wants to admit that the Trump administration's strategy is working, or is effective, but I think it is."
The disconnect between public perception and reality matters because it shapes how Americans think about immigration policy. When the debate fixates on "the Mexican border" while encounters from over 150 different countries pour through both northern and southern entry points, the proposed solutions inevitably miss the mark.
The border hasn't been "just about Mexicans" for years. In 2022, it officially became about everyone. The question is whether American immigration discourse will catch up to this new reality—or continue arguing about a border that no longer exists.    </div>
